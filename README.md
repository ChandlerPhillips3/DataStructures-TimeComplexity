# DataStructures-TimeComplexity

## Overview
This project implements several fundamental data structures and sorting algorithms in C++ to explore their efficiency, time complexity, and underlying logic. The implemented components include:

- **Bubble Sort**
- **Heap Sort**
- **Doubly Linked List**
- **Quadratic Hashing**

Each structure and algorithm demonstrates a different approach to data organization, searching, and sorting â€” providing insight into their trade-offs in performance and complexity.

## Data Structures: Doubly Linked List & Hashing Using Quadratic Probing

In order to see the Big (O) time complexity of these two data structures, their insertion and search times were recorded in nanosecond using the following librarys:
```
#include <chrono>
#include <time.h>
using namespace std::chrono;
```
Findings can be found in the
